Correctness: 15/15
Design: AB
Presentation: A

Notes:

- Rectangle definition - does not have data type for pen-down? Also interpretation for the fields should be capture all the invariants
- ListOfDots - template has incorrect function call - should be dot-fn
- Interpretation for LOD in world definition should specify dots for all rects
- rect-after-tick/rect-after-key-event functions should use template on rectangle
- set-rect-x/y functions should only take x and y rectangle coordinates and velocities to simplify design
- rect-pen-down/up = could have combined in a single function
